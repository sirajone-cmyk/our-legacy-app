              "Before we begin this blessed journey through the life of the greatest human being who ever walked this earth, it is important that we understand one word: Sīrah.",
              "Linguistically, the word Sīrah comes from the Arabic root that means a path. The act of walking from one place to another is called sayr — and Sīrah refers to the path a person travels throughout their entire lifetime. A comprehensive Arabic dictionary lists the following as meanings of this single word: conduct, comportment, demeanour, behaviour, way of life, attitude, position, reaction, way of acting, and biography. All of these meanings are contained within the word Sīrah.",
              "It is important to note that Sīrah is not a term reserved exclusively for the Prophet Muḥammad ﷺ. You could correctly speak of the Sīrah of Abū Bakr, the Sīrah of ʿUmar, or the Sīrah of any person — it simply means their biography, the path of their life. However, we have used this word so consistently and so lovingly in connection with the Prophet ﷺ that today, when any Muslim says the word Sīrah, we almost always mean only one person: Muḥammad ﷺ, the greatest of all creation.",
              "Sometimes, the early Muslims would use the word Maghāzī — meaning battles — to refer to the Sīrah. This is because the latter part of the life of Rasulūllāh ﷺ was largely defined by those military campaigns. Over time, Maghāzī came to be used as a term for his entire biography. Both words — Sīrah and Maghāzī — refer to the same blessed subject: the life of our Prophet ﷺ."

But the life of Muḥammad ﷺ — while there are references and glimpses of it throughout the Qurʾān — is most fully and most lovingly preserved in his Sīrah.

If you were to ask me today to describe him to you, I would not be able to — because I never allowed myself to stare.\"",

No other person who has ever lived has had so many people name themselves and their children after him. At this very moment, somewhere on this earth, a minaret is calling the adhān — and in that adhān, his name is being mentioned and praised. Around the clock, without interruption, in every time zone, his name rings out: Ashhadu anna Muḥammadan rasūlullāh. The name Muḥammad means \"the praised one\" — and no name has ever more perfectly fulfilled its own meaning.",

When there were too many Muḥammads in the household to tell apart, his father began numbering them. So there was Muḥammad the First, Muḥammad the Second, right through to Muḥammad the Tenth.

It is the white thread of the first light of dawn appearing on the horizon — the break of Fajr. That is when you stop.\"",

              "Reason Five: Understanding the Methodology of the Islamic Movement",
              "The daʿwah of Rasulūllāh ﷺ did not unfold haphazardly. It moved through carefully defined, divinely directed stages. It began with secret, private calling. Then came the public proclamation. Then came migration. And then, when the conditions were right, came open struggle and confrontation.",
              "These were not the improvised reactions of a man navigating difficult circumstances. They were divinely planned and divinely guided stages. Allāh ﷻ directed His Prophet ﷺ at every step. And that is precisely what makes them so important for us to study. These stages are the methodology — the roadmap — for any sincere effort to establish and spread Islam in any age and in any place.",
              "Reason Six: Studying Sīrah is ʿIbādah",
              "We have not gathered here to entertain ourselves. This is worship. There is ajr — divine reward — attached to every moment we spend in this gathering, learning about Rasulūllāh ﷺ. This is a ḥalaqah of dhikr. And the Prophet ﷺ told us: when a group of people gather to remember Allāh ﷻ and to speak of His Messenger ﷺ, the angels surround them from all sides. The mercy of Allāh ﷻ descends upon them. Tranquillity and peace cover them like a blanket. And Allāh ﷻ mentions them — by name — in a gathering far greater and more noble than the one they are sitting in.",
              "We ask Allāh ﷻ to make us worthy of that. We ask Him to make every word we hear tonight, and every word we carry home to our families, a means of light and barakah.",
              "Allāh ﷻ says: قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ \"Say: If you truly love Allāh, then follow me — Allāh will love you and forgive your sins.\" (Qurʾān 3:31)",
              "By studying the Sīrah, by coming to know the one whom Allāh commands us to follow, we are drawing closer to Allāh ﷻ Himself. This is ʿibādah of the highest order.",
              "Reason Seven: Developing a Muslim Identity",
              "We live in a world where a single global culture is being forcefully imposed upon every people on the face of the earth. Alexander Solzhenitsyn — the Russian historian and Nobel laureate — said: \"To destroy a people, you must first sever their roots.\"",
              "That is what is happening. And the only living ideology with deep enough roots to stand firm against this tide is Islam. Yet even within our own ummah, the damage has been done. There is a profound identity crisis eating away at our communities.",
              "We find our young people — practising Muslims, good people, people who pray — who know the name of every player in their favourite football squad. Who can describe the life story of a pop star in detail. But ask those same young people to name all the Prophets of Allāh ʿalayhim us-salām. Ask them to name the Companions of Rasulūllāh ﷺ. In many cases, they will not be able to answer. Our youth know more about pop stars than they know about the Ṣaḥābah. This is not their fault — it is ours. We have not given them their inheritance.",
              "The solution has two parts. First: we must develop a strong, living connection to Islamic history. We must know the lives of the Prophets. We must know the lives of the Ṣaḥābah. We must study the great scholars, the great civilisations, the great sacrifices that brought this religion to us. History is our umbilical cord. We are connected to a chain of believers that stretches back to the first man who ever worshipped Allāh ﷻ on this earth. Our roots go deep. We must not allow them to be severed.",
              "Second: our local identity — our nationality, our ethnicity, our passport — must never override our Muslim identity. We belong to something far larger than any country. We are part of the ummah of Rasulūllāh ﷺ.",
              "This Sīrah series — these lessons — are our answer to that crisis. Every time we sit together and study the life of Rasulūllāh ﷺ, we are reclaiming our identity. We are telling our children: you come from something great. You belong to someone extraordinary. You have a legacy — and it is your responsibility to know it, to honour it, and to pass it on."

              "Whenever a source of water appears in a desert, life follows. Birds began to circle over the place where Zamzam had appeared — and birds mean water, and water means life. A nomadic tribe called Jurhum, who were moving through that part of Ḥijāz, noticed these birds and sent scouts to investigate. The scouts returned with remarkable news: there was a well in that empty valley.",
              "Jurhum were a tribe that had originally come from Yemen. Yemen was the birthplace of the Arab people and the Arabic language, and it was the land from which many Arab tribes migrated in different waves over time.",
              "One of the great waves of migration happened when the dam of Sabaʾ was destroyed. The Qurʾān contains an entire sūrah named Sabaʾ, and Allāh tells us of a people who built one of the earliest great dams in the world. Because of that dam, they had a year-round source of water even though rainfall in Arabia was low.",
              "They developed a massive irrigation network that stretched for long distances. A semi-arid land was able to hold a large population because water was available. Some reports mention that a person could walk with a basket and return with it filled by fruits falling from the trees. Whether some details are exaggerated or not, the Qurʾān tells us they had wealth, cultivation, and ease of travel.",
              "Because of their wealth and cultivation, they did not feel the normal pain of travel. Their route was filled with villages and towns. But when they became arrogant and rejected the message of Allāh, they asked for the hardship of travel to be made like everyone else. Allāh destroyed the dam, the area flooded, and their agriculture collapsed.",
              "After that, their people spread out from Yemen into Najd, Ḥijāz, Iraq, and Shām. Some settled in Oman, some in Najd, some in Ḥijāz, Aws and Khazraj settled in Madīnah, and other Arab tribes moved into Syria and Iraq. This is how the Arab people spread out from their earlier locality in Yemen.",
              "Jurhum was one of the tribes that ended up moving out of Yemen and into Ḥijāz. Allāhu aʿlam whether their migration was before or after the destruction of the dam, but they were from those Arab tribes that came into the region.",
              "Knowing there was no water in that valley, they were astonished by what their scouts reported. They went to the valley — and they found Hājar.",
              "What followed is remarkable. These were warriors — a tribe of men with numbers, strength, and weapons. The woman they encountered was alone with her infant. Yet they did not simply move in. They approached her and asked: \"May we settle here?\"",
              "Hājar did not say yes immediately. She bargained. \"You may settle here — on one condition: the water belongs to me.\"",

At the centre of Makkah stood the Kaʿbah — the House of Allāh — the structure that Ibrāhīm ʿalayhi us-salām had built by divine command, in the same valley where Zamzam had gushed from the earth.",

It was as though something in the human soul recognised the sanctity of the place, even when the mind had forgotten why.",
